# Anony-Mouses

A super simple dating app for adults seeking flirtation, sex and connection.

**A little about you. A little about what you want. See who answers.**

£10 per calendar month, paid up front, with explicit manual renewal and no public free trial. A possible day pass has a £1/day ceiling but is not implemented. The concept preview demonstrates this proposed business model; it does not create memberships or take payments.

## The idea

- Describe who you are and what you want.
- Choose a pseudonym and a profile image; the image need not identify you.
- Enter a partial postcode such as GU2; explore gently pulsing potential matches and patron-written hints on a map.
- Browse profiles and exchange private messages and images.
- Messages and attachments automatically expire after two weeks unless saved as keepsakes.
- Each patron may retain up to 100 keepsake messages.
- Public identity claims remain unverified. Adults-only age checks are a separate requirement; see the data and privacy statement below.

Discretion from the neighbours is the aim. Patrons control what they disclose, but other people may recognise them or copy what they receive. Identity claims are unverified; absolute anonymity is not promised.

## Project status

Interactive static concept preview: fictional postcode matches, mood filters, surprise introductions, optional opening lines, scripted chat, session-only keepsakes and a two-step signup demo. No real accounts, payment collection or production messaging service yet.

Open `index.html` to explore the design. GitHub Pages publishes the project from the root of `main`. The commercial service will require suitable backend hosting; GitHub Pages is not the paid-service host.

The public preview uses no analytics or browser storage. Demo form details, selected pictures and keepsakes remain in page memory and disappear on reload. Hosting and font requests still disclose technical information to their providers; see the statement below.

See [the product brief](docs/product-brief.md) for scope and [the prioritised TODO list](TODO.md) for implementation and national launch planning.

## Conduct, privacy and reporting policy

**Agreed 17 October 2026.** Anony-Mouses is an introductions service for consenting adults: adult, playful and a little louche, with clear boundaries.

- **No sexually explicit content.** Pornographic pictures, videos and written messages are prohibited in profiles and DMs, even where both participants agree. Flirtation and a non-graphic description of what you seek are welcome. This replaces the earlier plan to permit explicit private images.
- **Private conversations are not routinely read.** We investigate reports and other credible indications of prohibited or illegal activity. Authorised access is limited to what is necessary for the investigation, security or a lawful requirement. This is not a promise of end-to-end encryption or immunity from lawful disclosure.
- **Act promptly and cautiously.** We aim to assess reports rapidly and may restrict access while investigating a credible risk. Confirmed prohibited material is removed; illegal activity can result in immediate account removal. Serious breaches do not receive three chances. Any repeat-breach rule is an enforcement tool, not permission for an initial breach.
- **No abuse or exploitation.** Child sexual abuse or exploitation, grooming, coercion, non-consensual intimate imagery, threats, harassment and fraud are prohibited. Preserve necessary evidence securely and report to the police or other competent authority when required or otherwise lawfully justified. Detected CSEA must follow the statutory NCA reporting process; cooperation and disclosures must be lawful, necessary and appropriately limited.
- **Reporting must be honest.** Deliberately fabricated evidence, knowingly false reports and reporting used to harass others may lead to restrictions or removal, with referral to authorities where warranted. A mistaken or unproven good-faith report is not misconduct. Nobody is punished simply because their complaint is not upheld.
- **Be fair and accountable.** Review the evidence, give reasons and a route to review decisions where lawful and safe, protect reporters' identities as appropriate, and correct mistakes. We aim for the highest moral and ethical standards and ask to be judged by those same standards.

These are the agreed operating rules. Production reporting, operator review, enforcement and appeals still need implementation and testing. Prohibiting pornography does **not** by itself establish exemption from age assurance or other duties: complete the service-specific children's access/risk assessments and document the necessary safeguards before launch. The age-check decision remains open under this revised scope. See [Ofcom's Q&A on moderation, prohibited content and age assurance](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/other/online-safety-act-explained-qa-web.pdf?v=409647).

## Data and privacy statement

**Reviewed 17 October 2026 — UK launch plan.** The public site is a fictional preview. The separate member service runs only in local development; live age checks, payments and production retention are not operating. The planned rules below are implementation requirements, not claims that the prototype already complies. Before real registration, we must publish the finished notice in the website and Android app as well as here.

**Our principle: discreet introductions, the least information needed, and no unnecessary history.** Use a pseudonym. We do not plan to require a real name, full postcode, address book, phone number, exact date of birth or GPS location for a dating profile. An age or payment provider may need some of those details for its own job. Pseudonyms do not make data legally anonymous. Membership will require an account, payment and the age/access safeguards established by our assessment of the revised non-explicit service. Whether a third-party age check is necessary remains to be settled; it has not been waived. Optional profile disclosures and marketing consent must remain optional.

### What the law means for this service

- **Adults only; explicit content prohibited.** Allowing pornography in DMs would trigger specific highly effective age-assurance requirements. Our revised policy prohibits it throughout the service. We still need a children's access assessment, appropriate safeguards and genuine enforcement; the ban is not an automatic exemption. A subscription or age declaration alone does not establish that children cannot access the service. Any age check does not certify a patron's name, honesty or safety. [1]
- **Collect less, protect what remains.** UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, as amended including by the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025, require a lawful purpose, proportionate collection, security, limited retention and an understandable explanation. Age checking does not justify building an identity dossier. Our preferred design receives a verifiable over-18 result, not a copy of the checking documents. [2]
- **Intimate information needs extra protection.** Sexual preferences, orientation and intimate exchanges can be special category data. Providing the service under a contract is not enough on its own: we also need an Article 9 condition. Our proposed condition for patrons' own intimate information is explicit, recorded consent for the specified uses, with withdrawal controls. Consent to marketing is separate. Another person's sensitive information cannot be freely uploaded just because the sender agreed. [3]
- **Reports cannot simply disappear with a chat.** We need risk assessments, clear rules, reporting and complaints processes, and proportionate action against illegal material. Detected child sexual exploitation or abuse (CSEA) has a specific reporting duty to the National Crime Agency. Ordinary expiry must give way to applicable evidence-preservation duties. [1][4]
- **Payments leave financial records.** Tax and accounting rules require records of sales, not a permanent archive of conversations. Payment providers and banks also have their own fraud, regulatory and card-scheme obligations. Provider requirements must be identified as such rather than presented as universal legal demands on patrons. [5]

### What we need, why, and who receives it

This is the minimum-data design for the live service. “Our team” means authorised people with a specific support, security or legal task; it does not mean unrestricted staff browsing.

| Information | Why it is needed / proposed lawful basis | Who receives or can access it | Retention rule or launch target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Private login, password hash, recovery-code hash and account reference | Sign-in and recovery; performance of the membership contract, UK GDPR Art. 6(1)(b). Passwords/recovery codes must not be stored in readable form. | Our service and contracted hosting/database processors; not other patrons. No email requirement for basic recovery is planned. | Account lifetime; remove on closure, subject to isolated legal records and backup expiry. Set a short, disclosed dormant-account closure rule before launch. |
| Over-18 result, check time, provider/method reference and any necessary expiry, **if an age-check workflow is required** | Enforce and evidence the assessed age gate; Art. 6(1)(c) where needed for an applicable legal obligation, or an assessed Art. 6(1)(f) legitimate interest if appropriate. Finalise necessity and basis before collection. | Age provider performs the check; our service receives the minimum result. Other patrons receive no checking material. | Keep the minimum evidence while the account relies on it; delete on closure unless a specific, documented obligation requires longer. Reject providers demanding unjustified identity retention. |
| A selfie, age estimate or identity document, **only where the chosen age method requires it** | Establish age, with an accessible alternative and a way to challenge mistakes. A face image is not automatically special category biometric data; unique-identification processing requires additional assessment. | Directly to the named age provider and its disclosed subprocessors. Our intended integration does not import the original selfie, document, legal name or birthday. | Provider-specific deletion deadline must be agreed and published **before collection**. Prefer immediate deletion after the check where feasible. No promised “zero retention” until verified. |
| Pseudonym, outward postcode district, description, preferences and chosen profile image | Show introductions and approximate district matches; contract plus explicit Art. 9 consent where sensitive data is involved. These are product needs, not government-required identity fields. | Other eligible patrons see what the user chooses to publish; our service and hosting processors store it. District pins are approximate, not a person's position. | Until edited or account closure; backup exception below. Do not add exact location or birthday merely for convenience. |
| Private text, pictures, participants, timestamps and keepsake choices | Deliver requested conversations; contract plus explicit Art. 9 consent where applicable. Metadata is personal data too. | Conversation participants; our service and hosting/private-storage processors. Limited authorised access for support, security, reports or lawful demands. Neither payment nor age provider needs chat contents. | Ordinary messages and attachments expire after **14 days**. Up to **100 keepsakes per patron** remain until unsaved or account closure, subject to the other participant's saved copy and the final deletion rules. Report/legal exceptions below. |
| Payment reference, amount, date, status, refund/dispute details and paid-until date | Supply paid access; contract. Keep necessary tax records under legal obligation; handle fraud/disputes under an assessed legitimate interest or applicable legal duty. | Named payment provider, its banks/card networks and relevant fraud services; our service receives transaction status/references. Necessary records may go to our accountant and HMRC. Our service must not receive full card numbers or security codes. | Keep minimal accounting records for the applicable statutory period: normally **6 years from the end of the relevant company financial year**, or **5 years after the relevant 31 January filing deadline** for a sole trader; statutory exceptions can extend this. No chat content belongs in the ledger. |
| Session cookie, IP address and minimal security/access events | Maintain sign-in and prevent attacks; contract for necessary sessions, assessed legitimate interests for security. No advertising tracker is needed. | Our service and infrastructure providers; limited authorised security access. IP addresses can identify or link people. | Proposed first-party security-log limit **14 days**, unless an incident needs a documented, reviewed hold. Local sessions currently expire after **7 days**. Provider logs have separate, published limits. Never log message bodies, passwords, cards or checking documents. |
| Abuse reports, selected evidence and necessary account links | Resolve complaints, protect users and meet applicable safety/reporting duties. Routine handling: assessed legitimate interests; mandatory reporting: legal obligation. Sensitive/offence data also needs a documented Art. 9 / Art. 10 and DPA condition as applicable. | Authorised safety staff; necessary hosting processors; NCA, police, regulators or legal advisers when lawfully required or otherwise lawfully justified. | Ordinary reports: proposed **90-day** limit, reviewed sooner on resolution. **NCA reports have different statutory periods**, below. A report is not permission to retain all unrelated chats. |
| An optional contact address and marketing preference | Reply to a requested enquiry, or send separately opted-in marketing. No marketing consent is required to buy membership. | Our support team and any named mail processor. | Enquiries: proposed **90 days after resolution** unless a dispute needs longer. Marketing: until withdrawal; retain only the minimal suppression entry needed to honour an opt-out. |

### Deletion, evidence and the limits of discretion

**Fourteen days is our ordinary-message rule, not a promise that every copy everywhere vanishes.** A recipient can save a keepsake, download a picture or take a screenshot. Removing your own keepsake does not remove theirs. The current local prototype removes ordinary conversations and their keepsakes when an account is deleted; the production sender-withdrawal/account-closure rules must be settled and shown before patrons send anything. Report evidence is separate.

For CSEA reported to the NCA, regulation 8 of the 2026 Reporting Regulations requires the report reference to be kept for **five years**, and the reported material, submitted information, assessment evidence and specified associated user data for **one year from reporting**. That associated data can include relevant files, communications and account connections from the preceding two weeks. This is an exceptional, restricted evidence store, not a blanket one-year chat archive. These duties are not implemented by the prototype's 90-day report timer. [4]

Our proposed backup limit is **30 days after a live copy is deleted**, with backups encrypted, inaccessible to patrons and used only for recovery. Restores must reapply deletions. This means an expired chat may persist in a backup for that additional period. This target must be tested and agreed with providers before it becomes a live promise. Holds for an actual legal duty or dispute must specify the data, reason and review date, and end when no longer necessary.

**We cannot promise protection from government surveillance or lawful identification.** A valid warrant, order, notice or statutory duty may require disclosure or preservation; sometimes the law prevents notifying the person concerned. We must assess the authority and scope and disclose only what is lawfully required. The Investigatory Powers Act does not, by itself, require every operator to retain everyone's communications data: a retention notice can impose specific requirements. This is not a waiver of our duty to protect data. Other providers may receive demands independently. [6]

The prototype encrypts private content at rest; it is **not end-to-end encrypted**. The service holds the decryption key. HTTPS and storage encryption reduce exposure but cannot make identifiable pictures, payment trails, provider records or someone else's device anonymous.

### Providers, current preview and your choices

The **current public preview** is hosted by **GitHub Pages**, which logs visitors' IP addresses for security. Its stylesheet requests **Google Fonts**, exposing the connection's IP address and browser request information to Google; demo form contents are not sent with that request. Their own policies apply. We should remove the external font request or host fonts ourselves before a live member launch. No patron records, private media or credentials may be committed to the public GitHub repository. [7]

**IO Zoom (hosting), Didit (age checks) and CCBill (payments) are evaluation candidates, not contracted live recipients.** Before launch we must identify the actual legal entities, subprocessors, countries, retention periods and processor/independent-controller roles. Overseas transfers need an applicable UK adequacy arrangement or appropriate safeguards and assessment. A UK/EU server address alone does not settle that question. We do not plan to sell personal data, target advertising from intimate information, or use private exchanges to train AI.

Patrons must be able to request access, correction, deletion, restriction and applicable portability; object where processing relies on legitimate interests; withdraw consent; and challenge an incorrect age decision. Withdrawal stops the relevant future processing but does not erase justified legal records or undo earlier lawful processing. Rights have legal limits and must respect other people's data. Access requests normally need a response within **one month**, with lawful extensions where applicable. Verify account control proportionately, rather than demanding a passport by default. People can complain to the [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/). [8]

**Launch requirements still outstanding:** identify the actual data controller and publish its postal/contact details and privacy contact; complete the data-protection impact assessment, safety/access risk assessments and provider/transfer checks; implement and test the stated retention and rights processes, explicit consent and age-decision review; assess ICO fee/registration and DPO requirements. No invented contact address or provider deletion deadline is supplied here. An unfilled controller/contact section means this is not yet a finished live privacy notice. [9]

Electronic marketing must follow PECR and UK GDPR: individual subscribers normally require prior consent unless a specific exception applies; corporate-address rules differ. A public email address alone is not permission for any campaign. Identify the sender, offer an effective opt-out, and keep marketing separate from membership and intimate data. Necessary authentication cookies can be treated differently from optional tracking; we plan no advertising cookies. [10]

## Development foundation

A separate [local backend](backend/README.md) now implements persistent accounts, district-based discovery and private text conversations. The connected member lounge at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/members.html` supports signup, sign-in, profile editing, schematic district discovery, accepted conversation requests, private text and image messages, keepsakes, blocking, local reports, recovery and deletion. Twenty-two automated tests cover the core and the HTTP journey, including cookies, access isolation and static-file boundaries. Production use is disabled; the public mockup remains fictional.

See the [foundation review](docs/foundation-review.md) for hosting, payment, age assurance and privacy findings and unresolved provider requirements.

## Provider selection and deployment

The [17 October age/access assessment](docs/age-access-assessment.md) concludes that our planned ungated member service is likely to attract under-18s despite its non-explicit rule. An age-only 18+ gate is the recommended launch design, subject to effectiveness/privacy review; a checkbox/payment-only alternative has not been established as adequate. See the [initial illegal-risk register](docs/illegal-risk-register.md), [commercial findings and outstanding acceptance gates](docs/commercial-readiness.md), and [prepared provider enquiries](docs/provider-enquiries.md). These are pre-launch findings: no real service, provider approval, purchase or enquiry submission is claimed.

See [the provider decision and cost model](docs/provider-decision.md) and [the deployment plan](docs/deployment-plan.md). Accounts now start unpaid; an internal monthly-payment ledger is tested, but real provider verification/checkout and production deployment are pending.

## Android track

See [the Android development track](docs/android-track.md) for a shared minimal interface and delivery order. The native app will use the same account/message service; no Android build has been released yet.
